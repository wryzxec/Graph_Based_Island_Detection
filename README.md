# Graph-based Island Detection using DFS/BFS Algorithms

## About This Project
This project visualises the Breadth-first search (BFS) and Depth-first search (DFS) algorithms used in the context of counting the number of islands in a grid of squares.

This was inspired by the LeetCode problem 'Number of Islands' https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/

**The problem states:**

*Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.*

# Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps to set up your development environment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 20.0.2 or higher)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (Version 3.9.6 or higher)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)


If your JavaFX project is developed using Maven, users should be able to import and run it in different IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other IDE that supports Maven projects. However, providing specific instructions for the IDE you used (IntelliJ IDEA in this case) can be helpful for users who prefer or are familiar with that IDE.

Here's an example of how you can write the "Setup" section to include information about IntelliJ IDEA and Maven:
