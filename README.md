# Graph-based Island Detection using DFS/BFS Algorithms


## About This Project
This project visualises the **Breadth-first search (BFS)** and **Depth-first search (DFS)** algorithms used in the context of counting the number of islands in a grid of squares. Additional features have also been implemented, such as outlining the largest island perimeter and highlighting island lakes.

This was inspired by the LeetCode problem 'Number of Islands' https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/

**The problem states:**

*Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.*
