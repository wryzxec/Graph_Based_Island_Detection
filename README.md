# Graph-based Island Detection using DFS/BFS Algorithms


## About This Project
This project visualises the Breadth-first search (BFS) and Depth-first search (DFS) algorithms used in the context of counting the number of islands in a grid of squares.

This was inspired by the LeetCode problem 'Number of Islands' https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/

**The problem states:**

*Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.*


## Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Java Runtime Environment (JRE) ](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 20.0.2 or higher)

### Import and Run the Application
Download the 'Graph_Based_Island_Detection_JAR.jar' file onto your system and run it.


## Features
*All images are taken directly from the project*

### Map Generation
Maps are randomly generated using a modified DFS algorithm. Maps are random and cell size is customisable.
